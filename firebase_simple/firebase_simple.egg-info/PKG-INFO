Description: # Simple Firebase Database Entry
        
        Use this basic programming language to teach young kids computational thinking of basic order.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        What things you need to install the software and how to install them
        
        ```
        Install Python 3.8.1: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1-amd64.exe
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        Connect to the database
        ```python
        
        from firebase_simple import database_fire
        
        database = database_fire.Db("database.io.url", "secure.key.path")
        ```
        
        Add values to the database
        ```python
        # To access the root directory, leave the path parameter blank
        database.update("/path/", {"value": 1, "array": [1, 2, 3, 4]})
        ```
        
        Save data with unique key
        ```python
        database.save({"value": 1, "value1": [1, 2, 3, 4]}, path = "/path/", ret=True)
        ```
        
        Load data
        ```python
        # To access the root directory, leave the path parameter blank
        data = database.load("/path/")  # This is a dictionary
        print(data["value"])  # This outputs: int 1
        ```
        
        ## Deployment
        
        This will tell you how to get the development env running
        Run this command into the CMD when python is installed
        
        ```
        python -m pip install firebase_admin
        ```
